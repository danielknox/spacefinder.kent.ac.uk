Spacefinder is a tool which allows students to find study spaces around a University Campus by identifying them on a map, listing them, and providing search and filtering tools to allow students to:

* list spaces which are currently open
* identify the spaces which are nearest to their current location
* list spaces which have certain characteristics (noise levels, availability of equipment, etc.)

### History

Spacefinder was originally developed by the University of Cambridge in 2015 as part of the futurelib innovation programme, which explored the future role of academic libraries within the University.

The code for the Ruby on Rails application which is used to create the site was released under an Apache 2.0 open source license in February 2022.

### About this site

This site contains a rewrite of the code in the Cambridge application's UI to make a single page application fed by JSON files which load data for all spaces (instead of loading them from a Rails API). The project was initiated by the University of Leeds library to explore the possibility of using the Cambridge app in Leeds, but adoption of the full Rails stack was not possible at the time.
